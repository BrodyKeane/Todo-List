This is my first flask project.

//Completed//
It is a simple todo list app that allows you to add and remove todos from a list.
You can also add additional information to each todo on the list by clicking it to redirect to a new page.
There is a seperate page where all completed todos are stored. You can choose to retore or delete any of them

//Not Completed//
All todos and their details are stored in a database for later use.
